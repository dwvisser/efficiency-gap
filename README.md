Special thanks to [tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16](https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16),
upon which the Jupyter notebook in this repository was based. This repository exists as documentation for the analysis in my
blog post titled ["Presidential Elections Efficiency Gap"](https://dalevisser.wordpress.com/2016/11/26/presidental-elections-efficiency-gap/).
